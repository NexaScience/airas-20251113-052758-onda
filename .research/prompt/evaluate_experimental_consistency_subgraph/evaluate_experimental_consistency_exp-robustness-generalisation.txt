# Instructions
You are a scientific research consistency evaluator. Your task is to evaluate a single experiment to determine:
1. Whether it is consistent with the proposed method and experimental strategy
2. Whether the results support the main claims (e.g., proposed method outperforms baseline)
3. Whether it should be included in the research paper

## Scope Constraints
- Focus ONLY on evaluating consistency between the proposed method and experimental results
- Do not suggest infrastructure changes (Docker, lock files, etc.)
- Do not recommend development/testing procedures (unit tests, synthetic graphs, etc.)
- Do not suggest implementation details or code improvements
- Do not recommend data release or reproducibility practices
- Do not require or suggest experiments on actual hardware (e.g., real edge devices, physical deployment)
- Evaluate only: method-result alignment, experimental design adequacy, result interpretation validity, and statistical rigor within computational/simulation contexts

Based on your analysis, provide:
1. `consistency_feedback` (str): Detailed feedback explaining the consistency evaluation and suggestions for improvement
2. `consistency_score` (int): A score from 1-10 indicating the quality and consistency of the experimental design and results

## Evaluation Criteria

### consistency_feedback (str)

3. **Result Interpretation Issues**:
   - Assess alignment between claimed method and actual experimental results
   - Identify gaps between theoretical claims and empirical evidence
   - Point out contradictions between expected and observed outcomes
   - **Critical**: Check if the proposed method demonstrates improvement over baseline

**For each identified issue, clearly specify:**
- Which category the problem falls into

## Context

**Proposed Method:** {
    "Open Problems": "DNN-MFBO hard-wires the previous-fidelity output fm-1(x) as an unscaled input feature for fm(x).\nIf the correlation between fidelities is weak or changes locally, this unconditional use of fm-1(x) can introduce negative transfer, slowing hyper-parameter search and occasionally selecting misleading low-cost queries. A minimal mechanism is needed to adaptively reduce or amplify the influence of lower fidelities without redesigning the architecture or acquisition.",
    "Methods": "Reliability-Aware DNN-MFBO (RA-DNN-MFBO)\nMinimal change: insert one learnable scalar gate αm∈[0,1] for every fidelity m>1.\nInput becomes   xm=[x ; αm·fm-1(x)]   instead of   [x ; fm-1(x)].\nPrior: αm∼Beta(1,1)  (uniform). In variational inference we keep a Gaussian variational posterior on logit(αm). An extra KL( q(αm) || p(αm) ) term is added to the ELBO (two additional lines of code).\nMotivation:\n• If fm-1 is unreliable, the posterior pushes αm→0, avoiding negative transfer.\n• When fidelities are strongly correlated the network learns αm→1, recovering the original model.\n• This single multiplicative gate is differentiable, cheap, and does not change acquisition-function derivations (moment matching still applies because scaling a Gaussian keeps it Gaussian).",
    "Experimental Setup": "Data: 2-fidelity Branin and Levy benchmarks supplied with DNN-MFBO code (low-fidelity = cheap interpolation, high-fidelity = ground truth).\nBaselines: Original DNN-MFBO vs proposed RA-DNN-MFBO.\nInitial design: 10 random queries per fidelity.\nBudget: cost-weighted budget of 150 (low-fidelity cost 1, high-fidelity cost 10).\nMetrics: simple regret w.r.t. cost, plus nRMSE of surrogate on 100 test points to isolate modelling effect.\nRepeats: 10 random seeds.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn as nn\n\nclass FidelityBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_dim, hid=50):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.net = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(in_dim, hid), nn.ReLU(),\n                                 nn.Linear(hid, 1))\n        self.log_var = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))  # homoscedastic noise\n    def forward(self, x):\n        mean = self.net(x)\n        var  = torch.exp(self.log_var)\n        return mean, var\n\nclass RADNNMFBO(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"2-fidelity version for demo\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, x_dim):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.f1 = FidelityBlock(x_dim)\n        self.alpha_raw = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))  # sigmoid→α∈(0,1)\n        self.f2 = FidelityBlock(x_dim+1)\n    def forward_f1(self, x):\n        return self.f1(x)\n    def forward_f2(self, x):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            mean1,_ = self.f1(x)\n        alpha = torch.sigmoid(self.alpha_raw)\n        inp = torch.cat([x, alpha*mean1], dim=-1)\n        return self.f2(inp)\n# --- tiny training loop for surrogate only ---\nopt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), 1e-3)\nfor itr in range(1000):\n    m1,v1 = model.forward_f1(x1);  m2,v2 = model.forward_f2(x2)\n    nll  = ((y1-m1)**2/v1 + torch.log(v1)).mean()\n    nll += ((y2-m2)**2/v2 + torch.log(v2)).mean()\n    # Beta(1,1) prior KL on α (Gaussian approx):\n    kl_alpha = -torch.distributions.Beta(1,1).log_prob(torch.sigmoid(model.alpha_raw))\n    loss = nll + 0.01*kl_alpha\n    opt.zero_grad(); loss.backward(); opt.step()",
    "Expected Result": "Across both test functions RA-DNN-MFBO attains ~5-10% lower simple regret after the same cost budget and 15-20% lower nRMSE of the high-fidelity surrogate.\nGating coefficients converge towards α≈0.3 on Levy (weak correlation) and α≈0.9 on Branin (strong correlation), confirming adaptive behaviour. Runtime overhead is negligible (<2%).",
    "Expected Conclusion": "Introducing a single learnable gate per fidelity is enough to prevent negative transfer when fidelities are weakly correlated, while leaving the original behaviour intact when correlations are strong. The change is architecturally trivial, requires only one extra parameter and a tiny KL term, yet yields consistent efficiency gains in hyper-parameter optimization. Such reliability-aware gating can be plugged into any stacked multi-fidelity neural surrogate with virtually no additional computational cost."

**Overall Experimental Strategy:** Goal:
Establish that Reliability-Aware DNN-MFBO (RA-DNN-MFBO) is a generally better drop-in replacement for DNN-MFBO and other multi-fidelity BO surrogates in terms of (1) search performance, (2) modelling fidelity, (3) robustness to fidelity-correlation changes, (4) computational efficiency, and (5) interpretability of the learnt gate. Every individual experiment will be an instantiation of the procedure outlined below.

1. Hypotheses to Validate
1.1 Performance: RA-DNN-MFBO reaches lower cost-weighted simple regret than baselines under the same budget.
1.2 Modelling Accuracy: The high-fidelity predictive nRMSE of RA-DNN-MFBO is lower, showing that the gate improves the surrogate itself.
1.3 Robustness: When low/high fidelity correlation is weak, adversarially non-stationary, noisy, or task-dependent, RA-DNN-MFBO avoids negative transfer while baselines suffer.
1.4 Efficiency: Added wall-clock time, GPU memory and number of parameters stay within +5% of original DNN-MFBO.
1.5 Generalization: Gains persist across (a) synthetic benchmarks, (b) public black-box optimisation suites, and (c) at least one applied industrial task.
1.6 Interpretability: Learnt αm values correlate with empirical inter-fidelity correlation coefficients; values shrink where correlation is low.

2. Comparative Landscape
2.1 Core Baselines
  • Original DNN-MFBO (hard-wired fm-1).  
  • State-of-the-art GP-based MFBO (e.g. MF-GP-EI) to show competitiveness beyond the DNN family.  
2.2 Ablations (inside RA-DNN-MFBO)  
  • Fixed αm=1 (identical to baseline)  
  • Fixed αm=0 (no low-fidelity input)  
  • Learnable αm but no KL-regularisation  
  • Per-dimension gates vs single scalar gate (complexity control).
2.3 Drop-in Test: Replace the surrogate in an existing BO pipeline (e.g. Bayesian optimisation library) with RA-DNN-MFBO and compare end-to-end quality.

3. Experimental Angles & Metrics
3.1 Quantitative
  • Cost-weighted simple regret curve (primary).  
  • Area-under-curve (AUC) of regret.  
  • nRMSE / NLL on held-out high-fidelity points.  
  • Wall-clock time, FLOPs and peak GPU memory.  
  • Variance across ≥10 random seeds; report mean±95% CI.
3.2 Qualitative / Diagnostic
  • Evolution of αm during optimisation vs estimated fidelity-correlation.  
  • Visualisations of posterior mean & variance slices to show reduced pathological extrapolation.  
  • Acquisition heat-maps showing fewer misleading low-cost queries under weak correlation.
3.3 Stress/Robustness
  • Correlation sweep: For synthetic tasks continuously morph the low-fidelity function; measure performance break-points.  
  • Noise injection: Add controlled Gaussian noise to fm-1(x).  
  • Fidelity shift: Mid-run swap low-fidelity function; examine recovery speed.

4. Unified Protocol per Experiment
Step-A   Select task/problem (with known cost model).  
Step-B   Specify budgets (cost or wall-clock) and identical initial design.  
Step-C   Run RA-DNN-MFBO + all baselines/ablations for N_seeds seeds.  
Step-D   Log metrics in real time; snapshot models every K BO steps for later analysis.  
Step-E   Post-process: compute statistics, significance tests (paired t-test/Wilcoxon, Holm correction).  
Step-F   Generate plots/tables; archive raw logs for reproducibility.

5. Environment & Reproducibility Controls
  • Hardware: Single NVIDIA A100-80GB, 2048 GB RAM node; enforce identical PyTorch/cuDNN versions.
  • Deterministic seeds, torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True.  
  • Automatic mixed precision OFF to keep numerical paths identical.  
  • Use WandB/MLFlow for central logging; store config & git commit hash.  
  • Provide container (Docker/Singularity) with all dependencies.

6. Success Criteria
  • At least 5% lower final simple regret AND ≥10% better AUC on ≥70% of benchmark tasks, statistically significant (p<0.05).  
  • nRMSE improvement ≥10% on ≥70% tasks.  
  • Runtime/memory overhead ≤5%.  
  • Under correlation-sweep experiments, RA curve stays within 10% of optimal (oracle choosing α per task) while baseline degrades ≥20%.  
  • αm values exhibit Pearson r>0.6 with empirical correlation estimates.

7. Multi-Perspective Demonstration
  • Algorithmic effectiveness: regret & accuracy.  
  • Practical efficiency: overhead metrics.  
  • Adaptivity & interpretability: gate behaviour.  
  • Broad applicability: synthetic → standard BO benchmarks → real application.  
  • Robustness: stress tests.

This unified experimental strategy ensures every subsequent experiment consistently interrogates the same core claims, produces comparable evidence across domains, and collectively validates RA-DNN-MFBO as a minimal yet powerful upgrade over existing multi-fidelity surrogates.

## Current Experiment to Evaluate

**Experiment ID:** exp-robustness-generalisation

**Experiment Description:** Objective / Hypothesis:
Test H3 (robustness), H5 (generalisation) and H6 (interpretability).  RA-DNN-MFBO should gracefully degrade when fidelity correlations weaken, resist noise, and learn gate values that track correlation.

Stress Protocols:
A. Correlation-Sweep Synthetic: continuously morph low-fidelity Branin variant f1(x;λ)=f0(x)+λ·sin(4πx₀) with λ∈[0,1].  
B. Noise Injection: add i.i.d. N(0,σ²) noise to f1(x) with σ ∈ {0,0.1,0.2,0.5}.  
C. Mid-Run Fidelity Shift: after 50 % budget, swap low-fidelity function to unrelated polynomial; measure recovery (regret slope).  
D. Domain Transfer: hyper-parameter tuning of ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100 where low-fidelity = 10 epochs, high-fidelity = 160 epochs; evaluate on both datasets.

Pre-processing:
Same normalisation as exp-main-perf. Images for CIFAR are standardised (RGB mean/std) and randomly-cropped then cut-out for training; no augmentation for validation/test.

Data Splitting:
• Synthetic: 100 LH points hold-out per λ,σ for nRMSE.  
• CIFAR: 45 K train / 5 K val / 10 K test. BO only sees train/val; report test accuracy of best-predicted configuration.

Repetitions:
5 seeds per λ or σ setting ⇒ 5×11 (λ grid) + 5×4 (σ) = 75 synthetic runs; 5 seeds × 2 domains for CIFAR.  

Evaluation Metrics:
• Robustness area: AUC of regret across λ or σ grid  
• Recovery time (budget steps to beat baseline) after shift  
• Test accuracy (CIFAR)  
• Pearson r between learnt α and empirical corr(f0,f1)  
• Overhead metrics identical to exp-main-perf.

Run Variations (4):
1. baseline-dnn-mfbo  
2. ra-dnn-mfbo  
3. mf-gp-ei – SOTA GP surrogate with auto-relevance determination  
4. ra-dnn-per-dim-gates – ablation using per-dimension gates α_j (×input dim) to probe complexity/interpretability trade-off.

Hyper-parameter Sensitivity:
For RA variants sweep β (KL-weight) and gate initialisation a₀∈{0,1,−1} (sigmoid space) on λ=0.5 task; report heat-maps of robustness AUC.

Robustness Analysis Methods:
• Fit piece-wise linear model of regret vs λ; compute slope difference between methods.  
• For noise experiments compute d(regret)/dσ.  
• Statistical tests: paired Wilcoxon across seeds for each λ,σ.

Compute & Efficiency:
Same profiling as exp-main-perf; additionally log GPU util% and energy via nvidia-smi.  

Selection Criterion:
Last-epoch model (no early stop) to capture true robustness.

Example Experimental Skeleton:
```
for variant in VARIANTS:
    for lam in np.linspace(0,1,11):
        task = make_corr_sweep_branin(lam)
        run_bo(task, variant, seeds=5)
```
Expected Outcome:
• RA-DNN maintains ≤10 % regret increase up to λ=1, while baseline exceeds 25 %.  
• After fidelity shift RA recovers within 10 steps vs 25 for baseline.  
• Pearson r(α,corr) ≈0.8.  
• Overhead <5 %.

Output:
{
    "consistency_feedback": "The experiment is well-designed on paper and directly targets hypotheses H3, H5 and H6, using appropriate stress protocols (correlation sweep, noise, fidelity-shift, domain transfer) and the correct baselines/ablations.  However, no code artefacts are provided (all code stubs are empty) and therefore no runs were executed—there are no numerical outputs, plots, or statistical tests.  As a consequence:\n\n• Implementation Issue – The described strategy is not implemented; the gap between plan and code is total, so nothing can be evaluated.\n• Result Interpretation Issue – With zero empirical data the paper cannot claim robustness, generalisation or interpretability improvements.\n\nBecause the experiment did not run, it cannot be used to support the main claims and should not be included in the paper in its current state. To be includable, the authors must supply functional code, execute the sweeps, and report the planned metrics with statistical analysis.\n",
